I am currently a Ph.D. candidate in the department of Computer Sciences at [University of Wisconsin - Madison](https://www.cs.wisc.edu/) advised by [Prof. Yingyu Liang](https://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~yliang/) and [Prof. Robert D. Nowak](https://nowak.ece.wisc.edu/). I obtained my B.A. degree in economics and statistics from [Cornell University](https://www.cornell.edu/), and I was fortunated to work with [Prof. Madeleine Udell](https://web.stanford.edu/~udell/), [Prof. Jacob Bien](https://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/jacob-bien/) and [Prof. Sumanta Basu](https://sumbose.stat.cornell.edu/). 

My main research interest is on the theoretical and empirical aspects of model adaptation with applications in adversarial robustness and large language models. For ongoing researches, I have been mostly interested in developing better alignment methods for [creative generation tasks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.10522) and providing better theoretical understanding for in-context learning. Also, I had previously worked on algorithm design for tensor decomposition problems. 

For more detailed information about me, please check out my [CV](/files/cv_yang.pdf).
